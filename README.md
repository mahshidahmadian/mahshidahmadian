# Hi, I'm Mahshid Ahmadian 👋

**Machine Learning Researcher, Statistician & Data Scientist** | PhD Candidate at Virginia Commonwealth University

I specialize in Probabilistic Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference, building adaptive models that learn from complex, high-dimensional data. My work bridges the gap between statistical rigor and scalable AI/ML solutions, with a focus on uncertainty quantification and spatiotemporal forecasting.

## 🚀 Technical Expertise

Machine Learning: Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling, Probabilistic Models, Predictive Analytics, and Spatiotemporal Forecasting.

Algorithms & Optimization: Custom MCMC implementation (Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs Sampling), and developing "learning" frameworks for automated inference.

Performance Engineering: Optimizing large-scale computations using HPC and Rcpp (C++) to handle massive environmental and healthcare datasets.

Deployment: Building Production-grade R Shiny applications to translate complex model outputs into interactive decision-making tools.

## 🔭 Current Focus

- **Advanced Modeling**: Developing a Hybrid MCMC algorithm for Bayesian inference in trajectory imputation—essentially teaching models to "reconstruct" movement paths from noisy data.
- **Scalability**: Leveraging C++ integration to make statistical learning algorithms run faster and more efficiently.
