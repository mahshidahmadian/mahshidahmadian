# Hi, I'm Mahshid Ahmadian 👋

**Machine Learning Researcher, Statistician & Data Scientist** | PhD Candidate at Virginia Commonwealth University

## 🚀 Technical Expertise

- Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling, Probabilistic Models, Predictive Analytics, and Spatiotemporal Forecasting.

- Custom MCMC implementation (Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs Sampling), and developing learning frameworks for automated inference.

- Optimizing large-scale computations using HPC and Rcpp (C++) to handle massive environmental and healthcare datasets.

- Building Production-grade R Shiny applications to translate complex model outputs into interactive decision-making tools.

---

## 🔭 Current Focus

- Developing a Hybrid MCMC algorithm for Bayesian inference in trajectory imputation: essentially building and training models to reconstruct movement paths.
