# Hi, I'm Mahshid Ahmadian 👋

**Statistician & Data Scientist** | PhD Candidate at Virginia Commonwealth University

I build Bayesian predictive models and scalable statistical solutions for complex real-world problems. Currently finishing my PhD while working as a **Virginia Sea Grant Research Fellow**, developing spatiotemporal models for marine ecology.

---

## 🔭 What I Do

- Develop **Bayesian hierarchical models** and custom MCMC algorithms (Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs Sampling)
- Build **production R Shiny applications** that make complex models accessible to non-technical users
- Optimize large-scale computations using **HPC** and **Rcpp** (R + C++ integration)
- Apply statistical modeling to **healthcare**, **environmental science**, and **public policy**


## 📫 Let's Connect

*I'm passionate about turning messy, complex data into actionable insights. If you're looking for someone who can bridge statistical rigor with practical solutions, let's talk.*
